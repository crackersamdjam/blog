I really wanted to go to Provence because I love nature, sunshine, and wanted to experience more of France. Flights in the first half of December were incredibly cheap: only 60 CHF round trip to Nice! None of my friends were interested, so I went ahead and booked a solo trip. The outgoing flight departed at 10h20, which was great as I had enough time to get to GVA from Lausanne. The return flight landed at 22h45, leaving me just enough time, in case of delays, to catch the last train departing at midnight.

## Departure and Antibes (Dec 18)
I left for Geneva in the morning and grabbed breakfast at the train station. The flight was only an hour, and the views of the clouds and Alps were beautiful.

It was a bit cloudy when we landed, but the warmth was much welcomed. I took a quick look at the free Asian Art Museum near the airport, then caught a train to Antibes. I walked around the old town and strolled along the rocky cape. With my full backpack, I didn't want to walk too much, so I frequently stopped to sit on the rocks and simply enjoy the fresh sea air.

As the sun set, I took the train to Marseille. The French trains, although fast, were dirty, wobbly, and no less expensive than Swiss trains. No one seemed to mind the 20-minute delay on the 2.5-hour journey, which would have been outrageous to the Swiss. When the notoriously delayed Deutsche Bahn trains arrive at the Swiss border, they're turned back to avoid disrupting the Swiss timetables.

## Marseille (Dec 19)
The walk to my Airbnb in the old town wasn't pleasant. The area isn't dangerous like the northern arrondissements of Marseille, but the neighborhood was dirty, the streets were narrow (as expected of an old town), and the biggest annoyance was the hills. Tourist guides said the old town was a nice neighborhood, but it was just a dead residential district of the oldest and smallest flats in town.

I had hoped to visit Château d'If the next day, but the ferry was closed for no apparent reason. I walked around the port and went to Plage des Catalans, another featured location from *The Count of Monte Cristo* 😉

The moment I stepped on the street in the morning, I saw the Basilica *Notre-Dame de la Garde* on a tall hill, dominating the city. I had never before seen such a commanding position upon a city: not San Francisco, Barcelona, nor Rio de Janiero. It was a long climb up, but the view was worth it.

On my way back down, I wandered through streets lined with tourist shops and stumbled upon a Christmas market where, unlike in Switzerland, the prices were reasonable! I got mulled wine and tried a freshly baked chimney cake for the first time. The fresh dough was incredibly soft and crispy. I also visited the Marseille History Museum, which, though it didn't have many artifacts, did an excellent job of showcasing two millennia of history. What's great is that all the museums here are free for European (not just EU) students! Plus, attractions don't charge foreigners exhorbant prices like Turkey and Barcelona >:\(

 My friend at EPFL had left his windbreaker with a friend in Mariselle and I was tasked with bringing it back so that he could use it to ski. It was now dark, and the wind had picked up to 50 km/h. Walking along Prado Beach and through Borély Park, I could barely see anything, and the wind made it impossible to enjoy the night. I put on my friend's windbreaker and immediately felt better. I'm glad he left it in Marseille for me to use 🙃.

## Les Calanques (Dec 20)
The next day, I headed to Cassis for a long day of hiking in the Calanques. I originally planned to do a four-hour loop around Cassis, but upon reaching the halfway point, I thought it was too short. I found that I could hike all the way to Luminy and head home from there. It would take all day, but I had enough food and water—why not?

First I had to get out of a calanque. To avoid a long loop, I opted to climb out from the side on an unmarked trail. This 180m climb turned out to be very tiring as I was on all fours. I thought things would be better now, but for the most of the remaining hike, I'd be exposed to the Mistal winds. As opposed to dying down as the forecast had predicted in the morning, the winds got stronger and stronger. I kid you not, the average wind speed during my hike was 73km/h, and the gusts were even worse. On the narrow rocks paths along ridges and sides of mountains, I had to hit the ground when it gusted every few minutes so that I didn't get blown off the mountain. Thank God I had my friend's windbreaker 🤣. I started the hike at 9h30 with what I thought was enough food for the day, planning to get an evening snack back in Marseille. But the cold and the energy I exerted digging my feet into the pebbles and rocks made me burn through all my food by 13h30. I was in a rush to make it to Luminy before the sun set and temperatures dipped even further. Luckily I was on a paved road by 16h00, and arrived at 17h00, just as the sun set. I was cold and hungry, so I treated myself to a massive kebab in Marseille.

This was the most difficult hike I've done, both in terms of the terrain during my climb out of a calanque, and in physical stress from the headwinds and crosswinds while hiking on unstable pebbles. The only thing that could have made this worse was if I had to carry a drunkard down the mountain 😆. As exhausted as I was this day, to my surprise, I woke up early and refreshed the next day, ready to take an early morning train to Toulon.

## Toulon (Dec 21)
I arrived an hour before the Naval Museum opened and I didn't want to tired myself out from walking with my full backpack, so I took the ferry across the Toulon harbour. The chauffeur asked where I was heading, I said that I was going to stay on the boat to do a loop around the harbour. I got the full experience of a tourist habour tour for a standard metro ticket.

The naval museum was small and I guess there wasn't much to show of the French navy. Unfortunately, they couldn't hold on to my backpack after I left the museum, so I had to carry my bag around the whole day 😩. The farmer's market here was huge. Half the stands sold produce, a fourth sold hot food, and other fourth sold clothing—no overpriced Christmas market stands 🐷. I had fried zuccini balls and paella for lunch. The zuccini balls were good but the paella was god-awful. I had expected more for six Euros.

I then hopped on the bus to the base of Mont Faron, where I'd make my climb. The road up was long and winding but there was a rocky trail that'd take me straight up. It was a 300m gain over 2km, but hiking up with my backpack destroyed me. I had a long rest at the panoramic point.

Unfortunately, to avoid the long winding road, I would need to take the same path back down. It was likewise difficult and as I was still hot from the hike, I rewarded myself with a big bowl of gelato. The server was patient as I asked all my questions about the flavours in French.

## Arrival in Nice (Dec 21)
In fact, everyone in Toulon (and I guess Marseille too) was so accomodating and kept to French. I hadn't expected this, and the contrast was very clear when I arrived in Nice in the evening. At the first two restaurants I entered, the waiters responded in an annoyed tone "no. full." in English and didn't even bother returning a "bon soir." The third restaurant finally had space, but after being told to sit anywhere, I was ignored. I went up to the waiters who were laughing with each other and ignored me. Then I left the restaurant, saying I'm leaving to the kid at the front door, interrupting him from the video he was watching on his phone. I have no idea why that last restaurant was filled by Chinese tourists when their service was so bad.

Thankfully, the rest of my experience in Nice was good. I found a place with good service to eat and write in peace. After dinner, I went to the Christmas market for some mulled wine. The Nice Christmas market was decently large and lively, perhaps comparable to Montreux but with reasonable prices. As I walked by, a girl asked "pardon monsieur," and I turned around. She then paused and said in English "could you..." and handed me her phone with the camera app open.

> "Prendre une photo de vous trois?"

> "Yes, can you do like..." gesturing to rotate the camera

I turned it vertical.

> "Comme ça?"

> "Yes."

By now, her friends were laughing that she hadn't processed I was talking to her in French. They pointed it out and we had a good laugh.

## Nice (Dec 22)
I was still tired from yesterday, probably from carrying my full backpack everywhere. I started the day slow, walking along the boardwalk to the farmer's market. I got to try Socca and got a vanilla flan for cheap: 2.5 Euros. I've found Vanilla flan to be my favourite dessert. It's not too sweet, while still being rich and creamy. Socca is a local specialty—chickpea pancake. The texture of fresh Socca was very nice: crunchy on the outside while sticky on the inside, but there wasn't any taste to it.

I headed up the hill for the viewpoint and found a beautiful cemetary on the rear. I keep seeing "died for the fatherland" engraved in stone everywhere in France.

In the afternoon, I went to visit the Masséna Museum. Turns out, it's indeed named for André Masséna, marshal of France 😉. It's his grandson's villa, filled with royal decor, portraits, and paintings of battles. I loved this mini version of the palace of Versilles!

At the ticket counter, the lady asked for my department. I responded that I live in Switzerland and that I'm from Canada. "Canada," she said with a suspicious look. I wonder what she was thinking.

My next destination was the Russian Orthodox Cathedral. Turns out the Russian Baltic fleet once leased a nearby port so there's a Russian diaspora here. I loved seeing the familiar Eastern Orthodox and Tsarist paraphernalia in the bascillica and basement museum—reminds me of friends back in Canada 😌.

My highlight, however, was dinner at a Lebanese kebab restaurant. The waitress, chef, and waiter/DJ were all so friendly. First of all, unlike all the food workers I met yesterday in Nice, they actually smiled and returned my "bon soir." I was about to walk past this place as there were only two others in the restaurant, but the food looked so good that I had to stay. Indeed, the meat plate was delicious. While I waited for the food, the DJ-waiter came to chat with me in English. And after I paid and returned to the table to write my travel journal. Then the waitress brought mint tea for me and asked what I was writing. Perhaps she thought I was a food reviewer? She came back once more with sweets and this time I had to protest.

I then headed down to shore to check out souvenir shops. As an old lady was bringing in her stands to close the store, an old man asked if she'd be open until midnight. She replied sarcastically that she'd be open until half past midnight—how bizarre 🙃.

## Èze and Monaco (Dec 23)
I took the train to a small stop by the sea and hiked up the Chemin du Nietzsche^[nietzsche] to reach the town of Èze, built literally on the sides of a hill. At the top was an exotic garden that charged a five Euro entrance fee. No one was there for the garden though—the garden was their excuse to charge a fee to go see the tip of the mountain.

There was a bus that came four times a day through the village, but when it ended up not coming, people started talking of ridesharing. I overheard an Indian-American couple book an Uber to Monaco and so I asked then how much it was. They invited me to join and so we had a fun ride together. I happened to have 20 USD in my wallet and the guy had 10 USD of change for me. Had he not, I would have offered him a collection of coins in different currencies: Swiss Francs, Turkish Lira, Romanian Leu, and Canadian Dollars.

Monaco was an incredibly rich and clean place. The best part was that the toilets were clean, free, and everywhere! Now of course the food was twice as expensive as in Nice, so I brought supermarket sandwiches to eat.

I headed back to the bed and breakfast, showered, ate a kebeb, and headed to the airport.

### The Return Flight

The guy sitting beside me at the airport turned around to ask the Easyjet staff what to do when he arrived in Geneva Airport after the last train has left. Her response was that he should ask Easyjet customer service at Geneva after we land. He and his girlfriend were going to Neuchâtel so I said we could split a cab as Renens is along the way. I wouldn't want to pay 150 CHF for a solo ride home 🙈. He said let's see what they say when we land. I, knowing what Easyjet is, knew we wouldn't get any compensation not legally required of them. When we landed at 1 am, the airport was dead quiet. We went to the customer service counters and of course they were all closed 💀. They said they'd wait until the next morning train, so that's what I did too. I found a dark part of the building where I could sleep on the floor. To my surprise, I fell asleep for an hour before the noise of the airport getting busy at 3h30 woke me up. I lied on my back for the next hour as my hip hurt from sleeping sideways and I couldn't walk properly. The train left at 5h00 and I had a pleasant sleep, woken up by my alarm as I approached my stop. I got home at 6h20 and immediately fell to my bed. Waking up around 11, I felt surprisingly normal. I would have expected this ordeal to mess me up, but I felt just fine (except for my hip). But in the future, I'm paying extra for an earlier return flight to GVA in winter, when there's a chance of "bad" weather—it wasn't even that bad; these people can't handle any snow 🙄.

## Le Fin

I spoke almost exclusively French for the duration of this trip! I hadn't planned to do this, but I was already in the habit of doing this in Switzerland. Unlike the other places I've travelled, Southern France was full of immigrants. Whenever I ordered any food and heard the staff talking in a foreign language, I'd ask what they're speaking and where they're from. The chinmey cake stand was run by Guanese, the kebab shop was run by Algerians, and the Lebanese restaurant of course.

I left feeling replenished by the sun and the sea. I should come here to recharge every year like Nietzsche did.
